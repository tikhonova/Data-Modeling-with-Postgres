# Udacity Data Engineering Project: Data Modeling with Postgres

## Introduction

We are given the following scenario:

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app (*'data' folder in this repository*).

They'd like us to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, constructing an ETL pipeline for the purposes of this analysis.
